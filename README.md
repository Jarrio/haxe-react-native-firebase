# haxe-react-native-firebase
Externs for react-native firebase

This has worked amazingly for me, but I have not tested it on recent versions of rn-firebase. The last known version I tested it on was "3.1.0". For setting this up - follow the documentation at <https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v3.1.x/getting-started>.

Known to be working:
- Google Authentication (I used the react-native google sign-in package to create the button)
- Real time database

Somewhat working:
- Basic Messaging

I wrote this up a fair little while ago so if there are issues, feel free to submit a PR or when I have time I'll give it a test
